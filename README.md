##Hi, I'm Alex, a student in high school, i started from html and then moved to scratch and then Arapahoe High School classes and managed to get a lot more relevant coursework: AP Computer Science Principles, CE Game Design, Digital Art Blk 1. I also #managed to get pretty smart with a Cumulative GPA: 3.569.

##SKILLS
#
 - Programming Languages: C++, Javascript, Python, Scratch, Html
 - Software and Programs: Unity, Scratch, Gamemaker, Visual Studio Code, Adobe (Illustrator, Photoshop)

## Projects (pinned ones or highlights)
-  red-light-green-light-alexashtodd — a program that lights up a green light when the target is moving >= 1cm/second and the red light lights up when the target is not moving(< 1cm/second).  ([link](https://github.com/alexashtodd/red-light-green-light-alexashtodd))

## How to run / try
- Materials
1 red and 1 green 5mm LED
2 130 Ω (Ohm) resistors or greater
1 1k resistor and 1 2k resistor
12 male-to-male jumper wires
HC-SRO4(make sure it has 4 pins!)

- You will need to use BOARD numbering to access your pins instead of BCM
- Wire your HC-SRO4 using this tutorial: Distance Sensor Tutorial. Follow the diagram exactly. Use pin 4 for the Trigger and pin 17 for the Echo.
